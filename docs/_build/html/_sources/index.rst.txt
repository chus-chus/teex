Welcome to teex's documentation!
================================

A Python Toolbox for the Evaluation of machine learning Explanations.

This project aims to provide a simple way of evaluating all kinds of individual black box
explanations. Moreover, it contains a collection of easy-to-access datasets with available ground truth explanations.

**teex** contains a subpackage for each explanation type, and each subpackage contains two modules:

   - ``eval``: with methods for explanation evaluation.
   - ``data``: with methods for data generation, loading and manipulation.
